This regex pattern r'\w+\W+\d+' matches a specific sequence of characters. Let me break it down:

Pattern Components:
\w+ - Matches one or more word characters (letters, digits, underscore)

\W+ - Matches one or more non-word characters (anything not a letter, digit, or underscore)

\d+ - Matches one or more digits (0-9)

What it matches:
This pattern looks for sequences where:

One or more word characters appear first

Followed by one or more non-word characters

Ending with one or more digits

Examples:
✅ Matches:

"hello!123"

"test@456"

"word#$%789"

"abc_!999"

❌ Does NOT match:

"hello123" (no non-word characters between)

"!123" (no word characters at start)

"hello!" (no digits at end)

"hello 123" (space is a non-word character, so this WOULD match)

Python Example:
python
import re

pattern = r'\w+\W+\d+'
test_strings = ["hello!123", "test@456", "abc123", "!123", "word#$%789"]

for test in test_strings:
    match = re.search(pattern, test)
    print(f"'{test}': {'Match' if match else 'No match'}")
Output:

text
'hello!123': Match
'test@456': Match
'abc123': No match  # Missing non-word characters
'!123': No match    # Missing word characters at start
'word#$%789': Match
The pattern is useful for finding text patterns where word content is separated from numbers by punctuation or other non-word characters.
