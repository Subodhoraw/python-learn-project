BEFORE SOLVING:
☐ Understand problem statement completely
☐ Identify constraints and requirements
☐ Define success criteria
☐ Consider edge cases and boundaries

DURING SOLVING:
☐ Break problem into smaller subproblems
☐ Choose appropriate data structures
☐ Consider time/space complexity tradeoffs
☐ Test with small examples first

AFTER SOLVING:
☐ Verify solution works for all edge cases
☐ Analyze time and space complexity
☐ Consider alternative approaches
☐ Document reasoning and assumptions
